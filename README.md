🚀 Arun Timalsina's 90-Day JavaScript Learning Challenge

Welcome to my **90-day JavaScript learning challenge** repository! 🎉 Over the next three months, I'll be diving deep into JavaScript, learning new concepts every day, and building small projects to apply what I've learned. My goal is to become proficient in JavaScript and web development by the end of this challenge.

 🔥 Challenge Overview

This challenge is structured into daily learning goals where I focus on a specific JavaScript concept each day, followed by a project or practical task to reinforce that learning. By the end of each week, I'll create a project combining everything I've learned during that week.

 🗓️ Daily Learning Program

- **Day 1:** Variables and Data Types
- **Day 2:** If-Else Conditions
- **Day 3:** Loops
- **Day 4:** Functions
- **Day 5:** Arrays
- **Day 6:** Objects
- **Day 7:** Weekly Project (combining Days 1-6)

> Each day's code and projects are stored in separate folders labeled by day, making it easy to follow my progress.

 📂 Folder Structure

The repository is organized into daily folders, each containing the code for that day’s topic:

├── Day01-variables
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── script.js
│   ├── styles.css
├── Day02-conditions
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── script.js
│   ├── styles.css
├── Day03-loops
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── script.js
│   ├── styles.css
├── Day04-functions
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── script.js
│   ├── styles.css
```

 🚀 How This Works

1. **Daily Learning**: Each day, I focus on a JavaScript concept and build a small project around it.
2. **Weekly Projects**: At the end of each week, I’ll work on a bigger project that combines all the concepts I’ve learned.
3. **Documentation**: I’ll regularly update my progress and share my learnings on GitHub and LinkedIn.

 💻 Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure for the web pages.
- **CSS**: Styling the web pages.
- **JavaScript**: The core language for all coding challenges and projects.
